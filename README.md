- 👋 Hi, I’m @albertoje04
  
- 👀 I’m interested in basically sharing my code with you guys. To share my work through my studies and my professional journey.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying the second course of my degree in Computer Science. I have learned to work with OOP (POO in spanish), data structure and more. I have worked with languages such as C++, a little bit of Python, some Java,
- some Bash(Script) and also worked with RISC-V. Now, I will be working with more Java, C and who knows how many more!

- 👍 I'm proud to say that i have chosen every subject I could in the bilingual option, in order to be able to code also in English. That also helps me to comunicate to everyone how I work and how much I love coding.

- 👨‍💼 I’m looking forward to work in a company where I feel I can learn more and more about this programming world. Also to be able to put into practice all that I have learned or that I will learn in a job where I feel really motivated.
